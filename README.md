# Added Feature: Resume Review Step in Workflow

## Part 1: Creating the Workflow

1.Make a new workflow: Head to profile -> General settigs -> Workflow -> Add a workflow
2. Fill in the info for the text fields, and select Resume Review underneth the drop down menu, Step type. (Note that you can add multiple reviews to one workflow. Each step is intended to be reviewed by different users or groups.)
3. Once you are satisfied with the number of steps, hit save.

## Part 2: Creating the Review
1. Head over to Documents, and select the document you wish to review.
2. Head over to the Workflow Tab and start the new workflow you created in Step 1. 
3. For each review step, the assigned user should hover over the stars for each category, and then click the star to assign/change their rating.
4. Hit review to finish the review step.

# Part 3: Review Tab

1. Access the average reviews by navigating to the reivews tab. If there are no workflows with a resume review step, then a message is shown to indicate the absense of reviews. Otherwise, the average of the reviews in all steps are shown.


# Native Installation

## Requirements

Before building Teedy from source, you will need to install several prerequisites, including Java 11+, Maven 3+, NPM, Grunt, Tesseract 4, ffmpeg, and mediainfo.
We give instructions for installing these prerequisites on several platforms below.

### Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)

```console
sudo apt install \
  default-jdk \
  ffmpeg \
  grunt \
  maven \
  npm \
  tesseract-ocr \
  tesseract-ocr-ara \
  tesseract-ocr-ces \
  tesseract-ocr-chi-sim \
  tesseract-ocr-chi-tra \
  tesseract-ocr-dan \
  tesseract-ocr-deu \
  tesseract-ocr-fin \
  tesseract-ocr-fra \
  tesseract-ocr-heb \
  tesseract-ocr-hin \
  tesseract-ocr-hun \
  tesseract-ocr-ita \
  tesseract-ocr-jpn \
  tesseract-ocr-kor \
  tesseract-ocr-lav \
  tesseract-ocr-nld \
  tesseract-ocr-nor \
  tesseract-ocr-pol \
  tesseract-ocr-por \
  tesseract-ocr-rus \
  tesseract-ocr-spa \
  tesseract-ocr-swe \
  tesseract-ocr-tha \
  tesseract-ocr-tur \
  tesseract-ocr-ukr \
  tesseract-ocr-vie
```

### Mac

```console
brew install \
  ffmpeg \
  grunt-cli \
  maven \
  mediainfo \
  npm \
  openjdk \
  tesseract \
  tesseract-lang
```

### Windows

It is highly recommended that you proceed to install Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL), following the link: [Install Linux on Windows with WSL
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). This will allow you to run a Linux distro (Ubuntu's the default) within the Windows environment, and you can then proceed to follow the Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) instructions to install the dependencies.

**Note**: This would mean that you should proceed to execute the following instructions within the Linux environment as well.

## Installation Steps

Clone the repository to your local machine (`git clone https://github.com/CMU-313/Teedy`) and then use Maven to build Teedy from source by running the following command from the root directory:

```console
mvn clean -DskipTests install
```

After successfully building Teedy from source, you can launch a Teedy instance by running the following commands from the root directory:

```console
cd docs-web
mvn jetty:run
```

**The default admin password is "admin". Don't forget to change it before going to production.**
